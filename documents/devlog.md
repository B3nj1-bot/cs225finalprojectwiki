# Development Log

# Week 1
## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week were to decide on a project idea, create the GitHub repo, and write the project proposal and team contract. 
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Decide on a project idea: Completed by all team members <br />
Github repo creation: Completed by Zayaan Ali <br />
Project Proposal Written: Completed by all team members <br />
Team Contract Written: Completed by all team members
## Problems Encountered 
We did not encounter any major problems this week. 
## Plans for next week
The plans for next week are to complete the data acquisition and processing. We also plan to start writing pseudocode for the BFS traversal on the graph.
## Optional: Questions for mentor
At this moment, we have no questions or concerns for our mentor.


# Week 2
## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week were to make corrections to the proposed algorithms and steps from the feedback we received, continue making progress with parsing the data, and begin discussing pseudocode for one of our algorithms (BFS).
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Editing/Updating the Proposal: Completed by all team members <br />
Data Acquisition: Completed by all team members <br />
First draft of Data Parsing and MakeFile: Completed by Benjamin Chang <br />
Development Log 2: Completed by all team members
## Problems Encountered 
We ran into some issues with project proposal and planning out our project. We ran into an issue that our inputs/outputs were not clearly defined and not all of the algorithms we had planned on using were completely viable. To solve these issues, we talked with our mentor and were able to change the algorithms we used so that we were able to have clearly defined inputs/outputs.
## Plans for next week
The plans for next week are to complete the data processing. We also plan to start writing pseudocode for the BFS traversal on the graph. We also plan on coming up with strategies to process the data, while having as few disjoint sets as possible.
## Optional: Questions for mentor
At this moment, we have no questions or concerns for our mentor.
